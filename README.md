# About
This will be my personal website.
It is a fantasy computer called made by
'Amethyst Systems' and based on the real
16bit 8086 architecture chip. We'll see
how far I actually get. I hope you find
it amusing. I am working on making it
work better, and would love to have
it navigatable on phones too, but it
might be a while.

# Notes
I wanted to use xterm.js with some cool
shaders on the terminal. But its a little
hard to do this efficiently. In order to
do this, I dragged down the addon which
adds the webgl2 renderer, and spliced in
code to allow my own shader to run.

Because of this, the actual shader is buried in
the RectangleRenderer.ts.
