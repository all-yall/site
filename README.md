# About
This will be my personal website.
It is a fantasy computer called made by
'Amethyst Systems' and based on the real
16bit 8086 architecture chip. We'll see
how far I actually get. I hope you find
it amusing. I am working on making it
work better, and would love to have
it navigatable on phones too, but it
might be a while.
